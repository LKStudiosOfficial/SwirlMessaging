# SwirlMessaging
A messaging platform for Windows 96.
Swirl is an alternative messaging platform by Kelbaz and LKStudios. It is IN DEVELOPMENT! Once the first build comes out, expect numerous bugs, glitches, and crashes. Please don't hate if it crashes, it is in development. So yeah! This will work like MsgBoard, but with extra things, like private messages.
